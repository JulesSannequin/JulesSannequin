### Hi there 👋

I'm Jules,

i'm a new developer 🐣 who is working essentially on Javascript , React , html and css. I just finished 2 coding bootcamps and i'm ready to have some work experience as a web developper. i'm conscious that the road is long and i have a lot to learn but i'm really motivated. i'm a car enthusiast and all my profesionnal experience was in this domain but finally this was not what i was expecting and i really needed to change, so here i am !! 💻
